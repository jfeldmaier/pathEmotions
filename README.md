# Description:

During decision making and acting in the environment humans appraise decisions and observations with feelings and emotions. In this project we propose a framework to incorporate an emotional model into the decision making process of a machine learning agent. We use a hierarchical structure to combine reinforcement learning with a dimensional emotional model. The dimensional model calculates two dimensions representing the actual affective state of the autonomous agent. For the evaluation of this combination, we use a reinforcement learning experiment (called Dyna Maze (c) Richard Sutton) in which, the agent has to find an optimal path through a maze. Our first results show that the agent is able to appraise the situation in terms of emotions and react according to them.

The results were presented at the IEEE RO-MAN '14 - The 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (http://rehabilitationrobotics.net/ro-man14/). The title of the paper was "Path-finding Using Reinforcement Learning and Affective States".
